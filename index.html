                <p>Rain World is a 2017 survival-platform video game developed by indie studio Videocult and published by Adult Swim Games and Akupara Games. It was released for PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows in March 2017 and Nintendo Switch in December 2018. The player controls a "slugcat"—an agile cat-like animal—that is tasked with survival in a derelict and hostile world. The slugcat traverses through the remnants of an industrialized ancient civilization as it searches for its family. It uses debris as weapons to escape from lethal predators, scavenge for food, and reach safe hibernation rooms before the deadly torrential rain arrives. Other game modes include multiplayer.</p>
