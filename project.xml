            Rain World is a 2017 survival-platform video game. It was released for PlayStation 4 and
            Microsoft Windows in March 2017 and Nintendo Switch in December 2018. The player
            controls a "slugcat" — an agile cat-like animal—that is tasked with survival in a
            derelict and hostile world. The slugcat traverses through the remnants of an
            industrialized ancient civilization as it searches for its family. It uses debris as
            weapons to escape from lethal predators, scavenge for food, and reach safe hibernation
            rooms before the deadly torrential rain arrives. Other game modes include multiplayer.

            Beginning in 2011, Rain World was in development for over six years by a two-man team
            and funded through Kickstarter, who intended to simulate a realistic ecosystem;
            creatures act independently of the player and perpetually wander through the
            environment. Rain World uses procedural animation and conveys much of its narrative
            through environmental storytelling, adopting an adaptive low-fi and electronic
            soundtrack. The player is given little explicit guidance so that they would feel like "a
            rat that lives on subway tracks", learning to survive in an environment without
            understanding its higher-level function.

            Risk of Rain 2 is a roguelite third-person shooter developed by Hopoo Games and published by Gearbox
            Publishing. A sequel to 2013's Risk of Rain, it was released in early access for Microsoft Windows,
            Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in 2019 before fully releasing in August 2020 with a
            release for Stadia coming a month later. Versions for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S released in August 2024.

            Players control a survivor who is stranded on an alien planet. To survive, they navigate
            through various environments, killing monsters and looting chests to collect items that boost
            their offensive and defensive capabilities. Over time, the game's difficulty increases,
            spawning more powerful and dangerous creatures. The game supports up to four players in online
            multiplayer. The game received generally positive reviews upon release. There are many characters, each
            one having a different way to play.
